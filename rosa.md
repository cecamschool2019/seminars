## FROM CHROMOSOME TERRITORIES TO RING POLYMERS: PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF UNTANGLED POLYMER MELTS


In this talk, I will review my work on the physical modeling of eukaryotic chromosomes. In particular, I will present results of detailed molecular dynamics computer simulations of a minimalistic coarse-grained polymer model which is able to reproduce with great accuracy the large-scale features of chromosomes, like their confinement to specific regions of the nucleus (territories) and the formation of contacts.
The talk will be concluded by a discussion focusing on the conceptual connection between nuclear chromosome organization and the physics of untangled ring polymers in concentrated solutions.
