## Molecular simulation and Machine Learning as Routes to Exploring Structure and Phase Behavior in Atomic and Molecular Crystals

Mark Tuckerman

Organic molecular crystals frequently exist in multiple forms known as polymorphs. Structural
differences between crystal polymorphs can affect desired properties, such as bioavailability of active
pharmaceutical formulations, lethality of pesticides, or electrical conductivity of organic semiconductors.
Crystallization conditions can influence polymorph selection, making an experimentally driven hunt for
polymorphs difficult. Such efforts are further complicated when polymorphs initially obtained under a
particular experimental protocol “disappear” in favor of another polymorph in subsequent repetitions of
the experiment. Consequently, theory and computational can potentially play a vital role in mapping the
landscape of crystal polymorphism. Traditional crystal structure prediction methods face their own
challenges, and therefore, new approaches are needed. In this talk, I will show, by leveraging concepts
from statistical mechanics in combination with techniques of molecular simulation and machine learning,
a that new paradigm in crystal structure prediction may be emerging. Examples demonstrating prediction
of structures of crystals, co-crystals, and phase transitions will be presented.
