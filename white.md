## Computational design of peptide-based materials with maximum entropy molecular simulation and data-driven modeling


Peptides are small proteins built from monomer units called amino acids. Peptides can be precisely
synthesized using solid-phase peptide synthesis and their constituent amino acids can provide functional
groups ranging from hydrogen bond-donors to aromatics. Peptides can be immobilized onto surfaces,
nanoparticles, or formed into hydrogels. This flexibility and precise control give a wide-range of potential
applications including self-assembling antifouling surface coatings, antimicrobial therapeutics, hydrogel
vaccines, and nucleating crystal structures. In this talk, I will present computational methods my group
has used to design peptides for antifouling, antimicrobial, and self-assembly. Our approach is to use
insight from nature through data-driven informatics methods and maximum entropy molecular
simulation. Molecular simulation seeks to model the dynamics of peptides at the atomic level. Maximum
entropy methods minimally modify molecular simulations to match experimental data. This enables better
accuracy, which is critical for modeling self-assembly of peptides, which is a complex multiscale process.
Broadly our goal in methods development is to combine physics-based simulation with modern machine
learning methods to create interpretable and accurate models. Most of our tools and methods are freely
available and this talk will describe how they can be used for systems beyond peptides.

__Short Bio__:
Prof. Andrew White received his PhD in chemical engineering from the University of
Washington in 2013 under Prof. Shaoyi Jiang. His thesis topic was the understanding
and design of non-fouling biomaterials. Prof. White did his post-doctoral work with Prof.
Gregory Voth at the University of Chicago as a Yen Fellow in the Institute for Biophysical
Dynamics. While at University of Chicago, Prof. White developed new methods for
combining molecular simulations with external data from experiments. He became an
assistant professor at the University of Rochester in 2015 in chemical engineering. He
has joint appointments in biophysics and materials science and is affiliate faculty in
chemistry and data science. Prof. White was awarded an NSF Career Award in 2018 for
multiscale modeling of peptide self-assembly. He and his group have authored 26 peer-
reviewed publications. Prof. White enjoys running, snowboarding and graphics design.
His artwork has appeared at the Visualiseringscenter C museum in Sweden.
